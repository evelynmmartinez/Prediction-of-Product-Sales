The data used in this project is sourced from the Big Mart Sales III competition on Analytics Vidhya. The dataset contains valuable information about products, outlets, and sales, providing a foundation for our analysis.

#### Key Visualizations:
To gain initial insights, we have created two key visualizations:

#### Sales by Item Visibility: A visual representation of how item visibility affects sales.

### Results and Business Recommendations:
Our analysis has led to valuable insights into sales patterns and trends. Through rigorous modeling and fine-tuning, we selected the Random Forest model as the optimal choice for predicting product sales. After tuning, this model exhibited improved performance metrics, including a reduced Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), indicating more accurate predictions.
